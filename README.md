## How To Use It

- Both parties should launch the application and press the [Generate] button. This will generate PRIVATE KEY and PUBLIC KEY.
  The PRIVATE KEY is hidden by default to make sure you don't accidentally send it to the other side.
- Both parties must send each other the PUBLIC KEY. PUBLIC KEY can be used to encrypt the data for you. The PUBLIC KEY cannot be used to decrypt messages and files, so you can safely share PUBLIC KEY via unprotected email or messenger.
- Type your message into the text box on the right side and send the auto ENCRYPTED MESSAGE from below.
- Paste the ENCRYPTED MESSAGE from the other side into the text box on the right panel and the program decrypts it automatically.
